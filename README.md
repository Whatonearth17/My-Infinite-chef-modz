Hi guys!

This is basically an infinite chef mod that strives to add everything and more R74n won't add.
Many new ingredients!

How to install:
Just simply copy the raw code from the ingredients you want to add, and paste it into infinite chef via inspect mode. The new stuff will immediatly take effect, no restart needed!
